# Solar Flares

Cosmic Sources in the sky burst intermittently in the Xray energy bands. Depending on the source and the cause, the burst amplitude and the duration may differ. An automatic identification system can be implemented to identify flares from raw data.  

This project works with the data collected by Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter's XSM (X-Ray Solar Monitor) to study the properties of solar flares.
